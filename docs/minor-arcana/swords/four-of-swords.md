# Four of Swords

- *Zodiac Sign* Libra ♎️
- *General Meaning*
  - *Upright:* The Four of Swords represents rest, recovery, and retreat. It indicates a period of pause after conflict or hardship, allowing the mind and body to recharge. It emphasizes meditation, healing, and gaining clarity before the next challenge.
  - *Reversed:* Reversed, it suggests restlessness, burnout, or refusal to take needed rest. It can indicate delays in recovery or a warning that continued stress may cause collapse if balance is not restored.

- *Career*
  - *Upright:* A temporary pause in work or career. Projects may slow down, but this time allows for re-strategizing and regaining energy. It’s a reminder to avoid overwork and prioritize planning.
  - *Reversed:* Overwork and exhaustion may threaten performance. Burnout is possible if rest is ignored. Could also mean frustration at delays in career progress.

- *Love*
  - *Upright:* In relationships, it suggests a period of calm or distance. Couples may take a step back to reflect, while singles may prefer solitude to process emotions before starting anew.
  - *Reversed:* Restlessness in love, unwillingness to face inner issues. May signal one partner avoiding necessary conversations, leading to further strain.

- *Relationships*
  - *Upright:* Time apart from friends or social circles to recharge. Boundaries and solitude help maintain balance. Reflecting before reconnecting leads to healthier interactions.
  - *Reversed:* Isolation turns into withdrawal, or restlessness causes conflict. Could indicate pushing relationships too hard without addressing underlying needs.
