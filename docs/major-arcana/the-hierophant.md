- *General Meaning*
  - *Upright:* The Hierophant symbolizes tradition, faith, institutions, and moral order. It reminds you to follow rules, learn from those with experience, and find a sense of belonging within community or systems. Upright, it often represents teachers, mentors, religious or spiritual guidance, and emphasizing growth through structure and discipline.
  - *Reversed:* The reversed Hierophant suggests rebellion against tradition and rules, showing unwillingness to accept authority or societal frameworks. It may also represent false beliefs, blind conformity, or rigid thinking. It urges you to examine which rules truly serve you, instead of blindly following or rejecting them.
- *Career*
  - *Upright:* In career, this card favors respecting systems and rules, progressing steadily within traditional frameworks. It suggests recognition by superiors or authority, or joining an established organization.
