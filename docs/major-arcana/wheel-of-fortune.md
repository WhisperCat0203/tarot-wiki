# Wheel of Fortune (X)

- *General Meaning*
- *Upright:* The Wheel of Fortune is a card of destiny, cycles, and inevitable change. It represents the ups and downs of life and reminds us that fortune is ever-turning. Upright, it brings opportunities, positive outcomes, and divine timing. It suggests that you are aligned with universal flow, and change will bring growth, even if unexpected.
- *Reversed:* When reversed, the Wheel warns of resistance to change, missed opportunities, or feeling trapped in a negative cycle. It may signal bad luck, delays, or lessons repeating until you adapt. It is a reminder to accept what cannot be controlled and to learn resilience.
- *Career*
- *Upright:* A sudden promotion, a fated job opportunity, or an unexpected breakthrough may arrive. Things may shift quickly in your career, and adaptability is essential. This card encourages you to seize opportunities, as timing will be crucial.
- *Reversed:* Professional setbacks, stalled projects, or missing the “right moment.” You may be stuck in a rut, resisting necessary change, or relying too heavily on luck instead of action.
- *Love*
- *Upright:* A destined meeting, a relationship entering a new phase, or karmic cycles in love. If single, this card suggests an unexpected encounter. In relationships, it often represents growth, renewal, or a turning point.
- *Reversed:* Instability, unpredictable changes, or emotional rollercoasters. Relationships may feel out of sync, or patterns of conflict may repeat. For singles, it may indicate repeated disappointments until lessons are learned.
- *Study*
- *Upright:* Intellectual breakthroughs, a renewed sense of motivation, and learning opportunities that come at the perfect time. Luck may favor academic pursuits, leading to unexpected recognition.
- *Reversed:* A lack of focus, procrastination, or being stuck in repetitive mistakes. Progress may feel delayed, or external setbacks (like scheduling or exams) could block advancement.
- *Health*
- *Upright:* Cyclical improvement and recovery. Old issues may resolve, and adopting new habits can lead to lasting wellness. Suggests a turning point toward better vitality.
- *Reversed:* Recurrent health issues, chronic conditions, or harmful patterns being repeated (poor diet, stress cycles, lack of rest). Resistance to lifestyle changes may worsen problems.
- *Relationships*
- *Upright:* Changing dynamics with friends, family, or community. Meeting new people who shift your path, or karmic connections entering your life. Fate may bring helpful alliances.
- *Reversed:* Stagnation or repeated arguments. Misunderstandings cycle back, and negative relationship patterns may keep reappearing until addressed.
