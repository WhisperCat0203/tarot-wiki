Upright, it brings opportunities, positive outcomes, and divine timing. It suggests that you are aligned with universal flow, and change will bring growth, even if unexpected.
- *Reversed:* When reversed, the Wheel warns of resistance to change, missed opportunities, or feeling trapped in a negative cycle. It may signal bad luck, delays, or lessons repeating until you adapt. It is a reminder to accept what cannot be controlled and to learn resilience.
