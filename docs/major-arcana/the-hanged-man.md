# The Hanged Man (XII)

- *Zodiac Sign* Pisces♓️
- *General Meaning*
- *Upright:* The Hanged Man symbolizes pause, waiting, and sacrifice. It reminds you to look at problems from a different perspective, to slow down, and release attachments or the need for control in order to gain new insight. It is a voluntary sacrifice, made to exchange short-term comfort for growth, spiritual awakening, or greater rewards in the future.
- *Reversed:* The reversed Hanged Man suggests passive stagnation or blind sacrifice. You may feel stuck, wasting time, or trapped in a situation where freedom is lacking. It can also mean excessive attachment or resistance to change, causing you to miss the chance for enlightenment that a pause could have offered.
- *Career*
- *Upright:* Career development may temporarily stall, requiring patience until the right timing arrives. You may need to reevaluate your goals or view your work/project from a different angle. By slowing down voluntarily, you may discover a better opportunity later.
- *Reversed:* Stagnation in the workplace is clear — you may be passively waiting or sacrificing unfairly. Your efforts may not be rewarded, or you may cling too long to an unsuitable job. The card warns not to mistake sacrifice for value; instead, learn to adjust direction when needed.
- *Love*
- *Upright:* Relationships call for understanding and tolerance. One partner may need to yield or sacrifice temporarily to maintain harmony. For singles, it suggests reflecting on what you truly want in love and waiting for the right connection. Pausing here is not a loss, but a chance for new potential.
- *Reversed:* Relationships may involve unequal giving, or overcompromise that leads to exhaustion. Singles may cling to past attachments or fantasies, making it hard to let go and missing new opportunities.
- *Study*
- *Upright:* Patience and calmness are needed in study. Progress may slow, but this is a valuable time for deeper understanding and reflection. By shifting perspective or changing study methods, breakthroughs can be achieved.
- *Reversed:* Delay or stagnation in academics, with efforts lacking clear direction. Resistance to change in study methods may result in inefficiency. A reminder to adjust strategies rather than waste time on unproductive paths.
- *Health*
- *Upright:* Health benefits from rest and adjustment. Proper pauses and recuperation will aid recovery. It also reminds you to maintain balance in mental and emotional health, as releasing stress will support healing.
- *Reversed:* Recovery may stall, often due to refusal to change unhealthy habits. It can also indicate sacrificing your body for work or others’ expectations, leaving you physically and mentally exhausted.
- *Relationships*
- *Upright:* Interpersonal dynamics may require empathy and seeing things from others’ perspectives. Compromise or temporary concession may be needed to ease tension. Short-term sacrifice may lead to long-term trust and understanding.
- *Reversed:* Relationships may become one-sided, where you give without receiving in return. You may feel pressured by others’ expectations, leading to imbalance. The card reminds you to set boundaries instead of endlessly sacrificing yourself.

- *Yes/No Question*
- *Upright:* No — this is not the time for action. Pause, wait, and observe how the situation develops.
- *Reversed:* No — the situation is stagnant and lacks breakthrough. Without adjusting your mindset, it is difficult to achieve the desired outcome.
