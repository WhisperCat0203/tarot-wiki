- *General Meaning* 
- *Upright:* Represents balance, harmony, patience, and moderation. It is the card of blending opposites, compromise, and finding the middle path. Suggests spiritual growth, healing, and adapting peacefully to life’s changes.
- *Reversed:* Symbolizes imbalance, excess, and lack of moderation. It can point to conflict, impatience, or refusal to compromise. Warns of extremes that disturb stability.
  
- *Career*
- *Upright:* Indicates steady progress, teamwork, and diplomacy. Success comes from patience, compromise, and combining different skills or perspectives. A good time for negotiations, collaborations, or gradual long-term growth.
- *Reversed:* Suggests workplace imbalance — conflicts with colleagues, poor teamwork, or overworking. May also reflect frustration from trying to rush progress instead of allowing steady development.

- *Love*
- *Upright:* A balanced and harmonious relationship based on mutual understanding, patience, and compromise. Passion and stability coexist peacefully. For singles, it suggests attracting love through openness and calm energy.
- *Reversed:* Represents disharmony, miscommunication, or lack of balance in the relationship. One-sided efforts or extreme emotional reactions may cause tension. For singles, it can mean difficulty finding balance between independence and intimacy.

- *Study*
- *Upright:* Symbolizes consistent effort and a balanced learning pace. You achieve success through patience, planning, and mixing different learning approaches.

- *Upright:* Reflects healing and recovery through balanced lifestyle choices. Encourages moderation in diet, exercise, and rest. Mental and physical health are in harmony.
- *Reversed:* Signals stress, imbalance, or harmful excess (such as overwork, unhealthy habits, or ignoring rest). Warns of health risks caused by extremes.

- *Relationships*
- *Upright:* Relationships flourish with patience, tolerance, and compromise. Conflicts can be solved through calm communication and empathy.
