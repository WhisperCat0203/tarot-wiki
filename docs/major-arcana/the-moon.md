# The Moon (XVIII)

- *General Meaning*
- *Upright:* The Moon symbolizes illusions, confusion, and the realm of dreams and intuition. Upright, it represents uncertainty, hidden truths, and situations where things are not as they seem. It encourages trusting your instincts and being cautious of deception, while also inviting you to explore the subconscious and spiritual insight.
- *Reversed:* Reversed Moon indicates clarity beginning to emerge after confusion, hidden matters revealed, or self-deception exposed. It may also reflect deeper fears, anxiety, or being overwhelmed by illusions. At times, it shows ignoring intuition or refusing to face reality.
- *Career*
- *Upright:* Work may feel unclear or unstable. There could be hidden politics, vague instructions, or misleading promises. This card warns against making impulsive career moves and suggests careful investigation. Intuition can guide you, but rely on facts before committing.
- *Reversed:* Secrets at work are revealed, leading to more transparency. While this brings clarity, it may also expose dishonesty or manipulation. It can also show that you’re denying dissatisfaction in your job, prolonging stagnation.
- *Love*
- *Upright:* Relationships may be clouded by uncertainty, fears, or miscommunication. For couples, hidden issues or lack of openness could cause doubt. For singles, it may suggest attraction to unavailable or mysterious partners. The Moon encourages deeper honesty and trust in your inner feelings.
- *Reversed:* The truth comes out in love, clearing away doubts. This may strengthen the relationship if both partners face reality, or it may lead to necessary endings if deception is uncovered. Singles may finally see through illusions about a potential partner.
- *Study*
- *Upright:* Lack of focus, unclear goals, or being distracted by too many influences. Progress feels slow because the path isn’t fully illuminated. This card encourages trusting creativity and intuition but also setting clearer structures.
- *Reversed:* Clarity returns, helping you refocus and set practical goals. However, it can also reflect denial of weaknesses, where ignoring mistakes leads to repeating them.
- *Health*
- *Upright:* Anxiety, stress, and psychosomatic symptoms may be affecting your health. Sleep disturbances, emotional imbalance, or unclear diagnoses are common under the Moon. It’s a reminder to care for mental health as much as physical.
- *Reversed:* Hidden causes of illness may be discovered, and recovery becomes clearer. On the other hand, it may indicate neglecting important symptoms or refusing to face reality about your health.
- *Relationships*
- *Upright:* Friendships and family ties may be affected by gossip, secrecy, or misunderstandings. Things may not be what they appear to be, requiring careful observation and open communication.
- *Reversed:* Truth emerges within relationships — misunderstandings can be cleared, but it may also expose dishonesty or betrayal. Healthy bonds grow stronger with honesty, while false ones collapse.

- *Yes/No Question*
- *Upright:* No — circumstances are unclear, and deception or illusion may cloud the outcome. More time and clarity are needed.
- *Reversed:* Yes — clarity is emerging, but be sure the situation is truly understood before acting.
