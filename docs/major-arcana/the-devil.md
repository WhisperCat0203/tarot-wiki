# The Devil (XV)

- *Zodiac Sign* Capricon♑️
- *General Meaning*
- *Upright:* Symbolizes bondage, desire, and material temptation. It warns that you may be trapped in money, lust, power, or addictions, unable to see what true freedom is. Upright, it shows a state of being bound, but these chains are not unbreakable. You may be overwhelmed by desires. The card also represents the shadow side of the subconscious: only by facing fears, desires, and obsessions can you gain true liberation.
- *Reversed:* Suggests awakening, breaking free, and release. It signifies becoming aware of unhealthy attachments or control, and beginning to seek liberation. It can also indicate the exposure of secrets or being forced to face your inner darkness. It reminds you to courageously break old patterns and restore autonomy and clarity of mind.
- *Career*
- *Upright:* In career, you may be driven by material temptation, ambition, or a need for control. Workplace dynamics could involve unhealthy dependence or oppression, and even overwork or being chained to profit.
- *Reversed:* Represents breaking free from toxic work environments or overly dependent career patterns. It may suggest bravely resigning or stepping out of constraints to seek a healthier path forward.
- *Love*
- *Upright:* In love, this can show dependency, desire, or an unequal relationship. Passion and physical attraction may dominate instead of true emotional connection. In some cases, it may represent a love triangle or being trapped in a harmful emotional pattern.
- *Reversed:* Awakening to escape unhealthy relationships. It may indicate ending a toxic romance, reducing codependency, or learning to establish healthy boundaries within a partnership.
- *Study*
- *Upright:* Laziness, distraction, or temptation in studies. You may neglect long-term goals due to indulgence, procrastination, or chasing short-term pleasures.
- *Reversed:* Recognizing bad study habits and beginning to correct them. Suggests determination to overcome procrastination and distractions, and rebuilding discipline.
- *Health*
- *Upright:* Health may be affected by addictions, excessive stress, or unhealthy habits. Issues may arise from drinking, overeating, staying up late, or other self-destructive behaviors.
- *Reversed:* Indicates recovery and improvement. It may mean quitting bad habits or achieving breakthroughs and release in mental health.
- *Relationships*
- *Upright:* In social life, there may be manipulation, control, or unequal relationships. Someone could be exploiting others’ weaknesses, or you may feel trapped in a toxic circle.
- *Reversed:* Suggests breaking free from negative connections, seeing through manipulation and control, setting boundaries, and building healthier social interactions.

- *Yes/No Question*
- *Upright:* No — indicates bondage and limitation. The situation is unfavorable; self-awareness and clarity are clouded by desire and ambition.
- *Reversed:* Yes — especially when you choose to free yourself from unhealthy attachments and restrictions, the answer shifts toward the positive.
